## Inspiration
Conservation of water through rainwater recycling and reuse.

## What it does
RunOff is an application that works with a rainwater tank. It aids the user in switching between using the water tank and main water lines. It also presents analytics on water usage. We also created an Alexa Skill for the app.

## How we built it
We built the frontend in Android Studio. We built the backend with node.js and mongodb. The hardware we used was a particle photon microcontroller and a servo to simulate the tank sensor and valve.

## Challenges we ran into
Figuring out how to interface between the frontend, backend, and hardware.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Everything

## What we learned
How to create an Alexa Skill. How to interface between the three levels of the project. How to add images, graphs, and more in Android Studio.

## What's next for RunOff
RunOff requires more development. After that, it will be ready to be in the hands, and Alexas, of the consumer.
